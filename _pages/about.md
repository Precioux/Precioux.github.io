## Hi Everyone! This is Samin!

Welcome to my website! I'm a Computer Engineering student at Amirkabir University of Technology, based in Tehran. I'm passionate about artificial intelligence and its applications in various fields like neuroscience, cognitive science, psychology, and philosophy. I'm also intrigued by advanced materials and chemistry.

Currently, I'm working on an exciting project for my thesis: developing a Persian chatbot. It's an incredible journey where I'm exploring the depths of Natural Language Processing and machine learning algorithms to create an intelligent and interactive chatbot that can communicate in Persian.

When I'm not working on my thesis, you'll find me immersed in my hobbies. I absolutely love reading books, capturing moments through photography, watching movies, and meeting new people! These activities bring me joy and help me unwind.

Through this website, I aim to share my AI journey, discoveries, and insights with you. Join me as we delve into the fascinating world of AI, chatbot development, and the wonders of Persian language processing.

Thanks for visiting, and I'm thrilled to connect with you!
