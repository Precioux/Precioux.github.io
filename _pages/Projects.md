- # [**Pacman**](https://github.com/Precioux/Pacman) <br>

  In this project, Pacman game is implemented based on artificial intelligence algorithms.

  - Principles of Aritificial Intelligence Final Project
  - Under supervision of Dr. Javanmardi - Amirkabir University of Technology - Fall 2022

- # [**Vehicle Factory**](https://github.com/Precioux/Vehicle-Factory) <br>

- # [**Machine Learning Projects**](https://github.com/Precioux/Machine-Learning-Projects)

  Projects for IPM Internship Course:

  - Deep Learning:
    - Handwriting Detection:
      This project worked on a dataset including numbers in different handwritings and tried to recognize and classify them into their own number group. The project used PCA in order to reduce the dimension of the dataset and after following the needed procedure used SVM as the main model to predict the number group for each handwriting.
  - Supervised Learning:
    - Classification:
      - Ad Click Prediction:
        This project worked on a dataset including data about advertisements on websites and predicting whether customers click on them or not, using classification algorithms such SVM, Naive Base, KNN, etc.
        - Heart Disease Health indicators:
          This project worked on a dataset including data about patients with medical details and predicts if there is a risk of heart attack for them.
        - Titanic Survivor Predictor:
          This project worked on a dataset about titanic ship passengers and tried to predict which passengers survived.
    - Regression :
      - HDB Flat Prices Predictor:
        In this project, using the dataset of different houses and their characteristics in the US states, we tried to estimate their approximate prices.
    - Unsupervised Learning:
      - Clustering :
        - Online Retail:
          In this project, it was tried to perform optimal clustering on the dataset related to the houses of the United States by k-means, DBScan, and Mean Shift algorithms.

- # [**Bank Security**](https://github.com/Precioux/Bank-Security)

- # [**XV6 Project**](https://github.com/Precioux/XV6-Project)

  #### This project is divided into three phases:

        - In the first phase we added some system calls in order to understand how system calls are implemented in xv6 operating system.
        - The second phase was about working with threads and realizing it's difference verses processes.
        - The third phase was much more complicated which was based on CPU scheduling, we implemented RR (Round Robin) algorithm ,preemptive priority scheduling algorithm ,preemptive multilevel queue scheduling algorithm and lottery algorithm in xv6 operating system.

  #### Instructor:

        [Dr.Seyyed Ahmad Javadi](https://github.com/sajavadi) <br />

  #### Implemented by:

        - [Hosna Oyarhosseini](https://github.com/hosnahoseini) <br />
        - [Samin Mahdipour](https://github.com/precioux) <br />

- # [**Message Broker**](https://github.com/Precioux/Message-Broker)

  This project is a message broker based on python
  A message broker (also known as an integration broker
  or interface engine) is an intermediary computer program
  module that translates a message from the formal messaging
  protocol of the sender to the formal messaging protocol (TCP)
  of the receiver.

      - Computer Networks Course Final Project

- # [**Mr.Jack Plus**](https://github.com/Precioux/Mr.-Jack-Plus-Version-)
  Whitechapel, 1888. Despite the police’s best efforts, Jack is still on the loose. The famous Sherlock Holmes is tasked with ending the crime spree of this maniac. But Jack has a few tricks up his sleeves and disguised himself as one of the detectives on the crime scene! It is up to Sherlock to unmask the madman; but he must hurry, or Jack will vanish into the night…

HOW TO PLAY:

Each player endorses one role: Sherlock or Jack. Sherlock's goal is to clear every other investigator until there is only one left: the one Jack is impersonating. In order to achieve this, he will need to have line of sight over his fellow detectives; each night Jack will have to tell if he is currently visible or not, allowing Sherlock to eliminate suspects. On the opposing side, Jack's goal is only to delay the investigation until dawn, when he can escape. Each night, both players will be able to reshape the board in order to shed a dim light on the streets of the city, or to remain hidden in the shadows...
